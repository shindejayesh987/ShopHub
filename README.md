# ShopHub App

ShopHub is a comprehensive multi-vendor ecommerce marketplace app designed to revolutionize online shopping experiences. Catering to both buyers and vendors, our platform offers a centralized hub where users can explore a diverse range of products and services from various independent sellers.

For buyers, ShopHub provides a user-friendly interface where they can browse through vendor profiles, product listings, and categories, enabling seamless comparison of prices and features. The app integrates Google Maps to enhance the shopping experience, allowing users to locate nearby vendors and stores easily.

Vendors benefit from a robust set of features to manage their stores efficiently.
